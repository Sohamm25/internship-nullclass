## Steps to Run

1. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file.  
3. Run all the cells sequentially.  
4. In the **fifth cell**, you can check the model's performance on the dataset.  
5. In the **sixth cell**, you can upload images for testing.  

**Note:** The model performs best when the input images belong to the same categories as the CIFAR-10 dataset.
