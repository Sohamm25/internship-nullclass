today is day 14 - now task 4 nearly looks similar and the way i have implemented task 3, i guess after reading task 4 i got to see only these 2 major changes or additions i needed to add in my task 3 code file, 
those 2 additions or changes i recongnized are : 
1.  interactively control the colorization process
2. model should dynamically change the colorization 
Now i reviewed my task 3 code and decided to edit it, I initially integrated a CNN arch in Task 3 to explore the possibility of using AI for automated colorization, however, I found that allowing users to manually select regions and apply colors provided more precise and user-friendly results, so thats why i decided to remove the CNN in Task 4 to simplify the tool and focus entirely on enhancing the interactive colorization process, to decide this i took help from gpt, claude to get idea of how can i build an effective tool.
today i mainly worked on interactive control for the colorisation so for that i have decided to add a color intensity slider on sidebar that is how dark the color should be , then i have made a plan for dynamic change in colorisation that is going to add a live preview so my entire day went there on researching how can i do that.
so overall my plan is clear and i think task 4 might not be a big challenge i can complete that tomorrow itself on day 15 if i work the whole day and i dont face any major issue.
i will focus on adding a live preview of the image getting colored and add the color intensity slider, etc 
today is day 15 - today i have completed the task 4 i have success fully added the live preview and color intensity part and overall the tool now looks very good, 
simply just upload a image select those regions using the interactive x, y co ordinate selection , u can see the live preview just next to the region selection, 
by adjusting color intensity u can make adjust density of the color how dark or light , 
the updated image is displayed with st.image, this is how a live preview of the colorized image is provided as the user adjusts the settings basically its dynamic. 
color intensity slider is created using Streamlitâ€™s st.slider. This slider returns a value (color_strength) that determines how strong the applied color should be. 
after extensive working today i have successfully completed task 4.
