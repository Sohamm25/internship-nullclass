day 16 - off day
dya 17 -
i took a off day on day 16, 
today is day 17- as i had reached the last task of the five tasks I have given I decided to revisit or go through my previous 4 tasks today and as I had learnt so many things while I was completing these four tasks so that's why I decided to check my code files for the previous tasks and I found out that there were some errors and also some fixes that I needed to do and edited every task file on my github. 
And then today I started with my task 5 and as usual I prepared the plan to complete this task so first I I decided to use my task four file for this and after some implementations i have decided to create a new file and start from scratch for this project . 
i have understood the problem statement and what I have to do so whatever techniques that were be going to be used here I have explor0de and research about them today. 
As usual, I began by researching different approaches and existing methods to handle domain-specific colorization effectively.  
I reviewed techniques like DeOldify, ChromaGAN, and domain-specific GANs to understand their potential use for this task.I explored how to structure the GUI to allow users to select an image type and preview the colorized output dynamically basically some streamlit implementations on test.py file and got idea how will i be able to build this web tool tomorow.
Tomorrow, i will finalize the approach and start implementing the basic UI and also the project..
