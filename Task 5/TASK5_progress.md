day 16 - off day 
day 17 -
i took a off day on day 16, 
today is day 17- as i had reached the last task of the five tasks I have given I decided to revisit or go through my previous 4 tasks today and as I had learnt so many things while I was completing these four tasks so that's why I decided to check my code files for the previous tasks and I found out that there were some errors and also some fixes that I needed to do and edited every task file on my github. 
And then today I started with my task 5 and as usual I prepared the plan to complete this task so first I I decided to use my task four file for this and after some implementations i have decided to create a new file and start from scratch for this project . 
i have understood the problem statement and what I have to do so whatever techniques that were be going to be used here I have explor0de and research about them today. 
As usual, I began by researching different approaches and existing methods to handle domain-specific colorization effectively.  
I reviewed techniques like DeOldify, ChromaGAN, and domain-specific GANs to understand their potential use for this task.I explored how to structure the GUI to allow users to select an image type and preview the colorized output dynamically basically some streamlit implementations on test.py file and got idea how will i be able to build this web tool tomorow.
Tomorrow, i will finalize the approach and start implementing the basic UI and also the project.. 
I am submitting day 18 and 19 report at once as yesterday due to network error I was unable to upload my progression report so 
day 18 report(13th march) - i have understood the problem statement and I am thinking to first of all finalize the domains so I can see clearly I have to turn a image into infrared then also i can turn it to a sketch or colour it, etc, 
also I have was researching on how can I make all those domains happen I found out about CV2 library and also about the edge detection it can do and i can convert images from one domain to another and i guess this method is traditional way as per my research from various resources. 
So my day 18 went completely on the working of this library I have learnt two things today it was about assigning colours to black and white images for that I used canny for edge detection and Dilation (cv2.dilate) (to enhance edges) and distance transform method from the CV2 library for the transition and then generated a colour map for it, 
then for the another function that I made using this library was to convert a sketch into black and white version and here the process in short was I used adaptive threshold that is a method from this library and at the end of the day I was able to get my results working well i didntuse any train model or i didnt train any model but I learnt that we can do it this traditional way as well.
Day 19 report (14th march)-  now due to my yesterday's research I found another way to complete this project traditional without using models without even training a model so I was thinking to continue today I made another function of infrared to colour and in short i used cv2.applyColorMap this mimics the infrared heat signature effect seen in thermal images and cv2.Canny() to sharpen features before applying color. And today after implementing all the functions I tried to integrated all of them all together in the streamlit web application. 
i did some tests and i had many issues and i kept on working those issues. A lot of time was invested today for this library of CV2 as I went on to keep researching many things I had in my path, 
Finally I have made a very good looking UI and tested all my functions that I have created using this library and it was absolutely amazing to see the results work very well.U just have to upload a image then the colorising feature or sketching or turning the image into infrared was working way more fast than the one i did so overall I learnt that when I use a pretrained model or use deep learning technique it is not as fast as the CV2 library, this library is very fast for task like these and after my extensive work and many many implementation from the past 2 - 3 days I found out this as an ideal technique but the difference is not that much so over all using a pretrainend model will be best in cases for complex tasks but for smaller task where images are involved this library works well too.
So today is day 20 and I was trying this CV library yesterday and I have completed the task 5 using this library but I was trying to use some pretrained models for completing these tasks, now the problem is that when are u operating on operations or tasks of gen ai then computational work or overall time and use of resurces i pretty high , i am saying this from todays expeirence because i had to download 1.5 gb minimum size of models and use them to complete those tasks which was very difficult as i had decided some domains and so for each domain i had seperate seperate files in size of GBs, so today i have downloaded them all and i have tested all those model by creating some basic functions as using them was not very difficult and after extensive work and research today i had another approach nearly ready for the project but overall i am stuck on whic apporoach to take as if i go with cv2 its compatible and conventional, faster as well, but using pretraineed models take time and also high use of resoucres so i am thinking to make that decision tomorrow and finally complete all my tasks
so day 21 was a tough day beacuse i had to explore the area of pretrained models being used in the code which were imported from famous open source github repositories, for ex-
1 - colorise model - https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify?tab=readme-ov-file 
2 - sketch to color - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MwsExdh_qViygaZ8tYlPBu9R2YGl0TeQ/view?usp=drive_link 
now these models were in size of gbs and it took a lot of time for me to get used to these models usage in my project, now here using these kind of models needed some experience so i had to create a sperate files for each domain and try each and every model out, now doing so caused many many issues which i had to research everytime and sort it out, but at the end of day i had my sketch model and infrared model and colorised model working really well, now tomorrow i am thinking of completing task 5 and preparing resouces and making repository ready for final submission. i am thinking to give my complete day tomorrow so i will complete all tomorrow itself.
today is day 22 - i have completed my task 5 and finally all the tasks are completed, so i decided to review my each and every project and put together all the points, topics, concpets and techniques i learned , so todays day went in completion of task 5 which invovled adding or you can say testing some features for each domain i have like the color strength and then the sketch line strength, the color intensity all these things which already where the part of the libraries i was using so it was not very hard to implement and test out and then after few more implementations i have finalised and finished my task 5 and then i went on to reviewing my previous tasks code, later i focused on the final submission i needed to submit so i prepared all the important and required files and i am left with just a few things , so i am thinking to do my final submission tomorrow , so tomorrow probably might be the last day of my internship.
Today is day 23 - i have prepared my report and also rearranged my github repositories and with help of gpt made those markdowns file looking good, then i focused on the files whether they meet the requirements or not, and i found some issues in task 4 so i have sorted a major flaw out , and then i checked whether i have saved the model architecture of all and also i rechecked all those model architecture by loading it back again, so my complete day went with all the checking work, fixing issues, making report and preparing resources for final submission , tomorrow is my last for sure as i will be submitting it tomorrow.
